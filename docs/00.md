Gigahorse
=========

Gigahorse is an HTTP client for Scala that can wrap either
[Square OkHttp][okhttp], [Async Http Client][AHC], or [Akka HTTP][akkahttp] underneath.

### Setup

For Square OkHttp Client:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.eed3si9n" %% "gigahorse-okhttp" % "$gigahorse_version$"
```

For Async HTTP Client:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.eed3si9n" %% "gigahorse-asynchttpclient" % "$gigahorse_version$"
```

Akka HTTP support is experimental:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.eed3si9n" %% "gigahorse-akka-http" % "$gigahorse_version$"
```

### Dependencies

Gigahorse-OkHttp depends on Scala and [Square OkHttp][okhttp].
It also depends on [Lightbend SSL Config][sslconfig] and [Lightbend Config][config].

Gigahorse-AsyncHttpClient depends on Scala, [AHC 2.0][AHC], which brings in [Netty 4][netty].

Gigahorse-Akka-HTTP is experimental, and not all features are hooked up.

### Credits

- The implementation was originally based from [The Play WS API][ws],
  including the way AHC is called and the choice of default values.
  In particular, it uses [Lightbend Config][config] and [@wsargent][@wsargent]'s [SSL Config][sslconfig],
  which uses securer defaults.
- API design is also strongly influenced by that of [Dispatch Reboot][dispatch] by [@n8han][@n8han].
- All datatypes are generated using [Contraband][contraband], which [@Duhemm][@Duhemm] and I worked on.
- [@alexdupre][@alexdupre] contributed AHC 2.0 migration and WebSocket support.
- Finally, props to underlying HTTP libraries for the actual HTTP work.

### Quick start

Here's a quick example of how to make a GET call using Gigahorse:

```console
scala> import gigahorse._, support.okhttp.Gigahorse
scala> import scala.concurrent._, duration._
scala> val http = Gigahorse.http(Gigahorse.config)
scala> val r = Gigahorse.url("https://api.duckduckgo.com").get.
         addQueryString(
           "q" -> "1 + 1"
         )
scala> val f = http.run(r, Gigahorse.asString andThen {_.take(60)})
scala> Await.result(f, 120.seconds)
scala> http.close()
```
